Components on this board:  

-ESP32 Pico D4 wifi microprocessor  
-CP2104N USB Interface  
-LSM6DS3 Gyroscope  
-HDC1080DMBT Humidity/Temperature sensor  
-1.54" TFT Lcd  
-DW01A LiPo protection  
-SL4054ST25P LiPo charger  
-Right angle pushbuttons x4  
-USB C connector 

I had one of these 1.54"x1.54" BuyDisplay lcds laying around for a few months and decided to see if it was possible to fit everything on the backside of and lcd. It has two sensors, four buttons and LiPo battery protection in case your battery has none built in.
